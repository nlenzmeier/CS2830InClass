        <h2>What is PicoSure?</h2>
          
        <p>PicoSure is the latest advancement in laser technology for safe and effective tattoo removal. Remove tattoos faster with greater efficacy than ever before with the first and only picosecond laser! Take a look at the photos at the top of this page. The photo on the left shows untreated tattoo ink. The center photo shows the older nanosecond treatment. The photo on the right demonstrates have the picosecond laser breaks the ink into even finer particulate. Great shattering enables your body to clear the tattoo ink even faster!</p>
          
        <h2>How does the PicoSure compare to the older tattoo removal technology?</h2>
          
          <p>PicoSure uses the latest technology to remove ink colors and brown spots by delivering ultra- short picosecond pulses of energy into the skin. The pulses create a photomechanical effect, or PressureWave™, that targets ink and brown spots while avoiding unmarked tissue. Unlike traditional Q-switched lasers which break pigment into pebble-like granules, PressureWave shatters the ink and brown spots into tiny dust-like particles which are more easily eliminated by the body. This results in clearer skin in fewer treatments with improved recovery.</p>
          
          <h2>What type of tattoos can be removed with PicoSure?</h2>
          
          <p>PicoSure can be used to remove a variety of tattoo colors and types. Difficult ink colors, such as blue and green, and previously treated tattoos can effectively be removed with PicoSure.</p>
          
          <h2>How many treatments will tattoo removal require?</h2>
          
          <p>With PicoSure, you will see greater results in fewer treatments. During the free consultation, Dr. O'Young will evaluate your tattoo and recommend a realistic treatment regime to help you achieve the best results.</p>
          
          <h2>How often will I need treatments?</h2>
          
          <p>Typically it takes about 6 weeks for the body to start breaking down the ink and even though the tattoo may appear healed, it is not. Getting treated sooner than that will not remove the tattoo any quicker and can also put you at risk for scarring.</p>
          
          <h2>Will I see results after the first treatment?</h2>
          
          <p>Every patient and tattoo responds differently. Some patients see improved clearance after the first treatment, while others may take a few treatments to see results. Following the recommended post treatment protocol will likely improve the results and reduce the chance of adverse events.</p>
          
          <h2>What are the limitations after treatment?</h2>
          
          <p>We recommend that patients limit their physical activity for the first 24-48 hours to avoid irritation or harm to the treated area. After that, patients can go about their days normally, however sun exposure should be limited until the treatment area is completely healed.</p>
          
          <h2>Can I have only a portion of my tattoo removed?</h2>
          
          <p>Yes, PicoSure delivers energy so precisely that even the smallest areas of a tattoo can be removed without affecting the surrounding tattoo.</p>
          
          <h2>Does tattoo removal hurt?</h2>
          
          <p>This procedure is slightly more uncomfortable than getting a tattoo, however it is very fast. Most treatments take between 25-60 seconds. We apply numbing cream 30 minutes before the treatment and chill the area with cold air while performing the treatment.</p>
          
          <h2>I got my tattoo one week ago. Can I have it removed right now?</h2>
          
          <p>Tattoo regret can happen at any time, sometimes as early as the day after a tattoo is completed. Because your skin needs time to heal from the tattoo procedure, we require each patient to wait at least six weeks to start the removal process.</p>
          
          <h2>How much does it cost to have PicoSure tattoo removal?</h2>
          
          <p>The cost of laser tattoo removal depends on several factors, including the size of tattoo and the number of treatments it will require. At your consultation, Dr. O’Young will provide you a price estimate for the treatment series.</p>
          
          
          <h1 style = "color: green">Laser Hair Removal</h1>
          
          <h2>See Brazil Without Leaving the Country!</h2>
          
          <p>I love performing laser hair reduction because it is a procedure that really works.</p>
          
          <p>After giving up obstetrics, I investigated other services I could offer my patients. I sampled a ton of laser devices and underwent many various laser treatments myself. There's nothing like being your own guinea pig! My goal was to find something that actually works, something with clear benefits for my patients. I hate it when I get suckered into purchasing something that doesn't really work and then feel ripped off. I practice medicine the same way. If I don't think a gynecologic surgery or drug is going to help your medical problem, I'm going to discourage you from having the procedure or using the drug.</p>
          
          <p>Popular areas for hair reduction are underarms, legs, arms, upper lip, chin and bikini lines of all types, including Brazilians. My male clients have chosen to have their backs, necks and beards done. All skin colors can be treated by my laser: Black, White, Hispanic and Asian.</p>
          
          <h2>How does the laser remove hair? </h2>
          
          <p>The laser emits a beam of light that is attracted to the pigment or melanin in the hair follicle that is in an active growing cycle. Pre-determined pulse duration and energy settings are directed at and absorbed by the hair follicles, disabling the growth of the follicles, resulting in quick, safe, and effective hair removal. </p>
          
          <h2>What is the advantage of using a laser? </h2>
          
          <p>Lasers are precise instruments that can be adjusted to the exact parameters that will specifically disable the hair follicle. The laser uses a wide beam that treats many hairs at once instead of treating hair-by-hair like electrolysis. Because of this, large areas such as your legs, arms, or back can be treated in a short period of time. You will see results that last far longer than tweezing, waxing, shaving, chemical depilation, or other temporary methods. </p>
          
          <h2>What does the laser treatment feel like? </h2>
          
          <p>The treatment does have a slight prickly or stinging sensation. Most of our clients are able to tolerate the treatment without difficulty. However, every person’s level of sensitivity is different and treatment areas may vary. </p>
          
          <h2>What happens to the skin after laser treatment? </h2>
          
          <p>Reddening of the skin is the desired reaction. The redness usually subsides within a few minutes to a few hours and returns to normal. Since the laser is not invasive in any way, no bandages are necessary. You are able to re-apply your make-up, return to work, and continue with your normal daily activities immediately following treatment. </p>
          
          <h2>How many laser treatments will I need? </h2>
          
          <p>It has been our experience that most of our patients are able to discontinue treatments, knowing they will probably need an occasional touchup, after an average of 6-8 treatments, providing that the recommended treatment schedule is followed. It is also important to understand that results may vary depending on the individuals hair type, their stress levels, certain medications and different hormone levels. Keep in mind some individuals will require fewer treatments and some will require more treatments depending on the results desired. </p>
          
          <h2>Is laser hair removal permanent?</h2>
          
          <p>The FDA has cleared laser hair removal, regardless of the laser, for “Permanent Hair Reduction” only. Based on our experience we believe that the hair treated will probably not re-grow. Each individual’s treatment response may be different because of their hair or skin type and given that there are between 500 and 1000 follicles per square cm, of which many are dormant at the time of treatment, we have no way of knowing if and when they may start growing due to stress levels, certain medications and different hormone levels.  </p>
          
          <h2>What to expect after laser treatment? </h2>
          
          <p>After your initial treatment, you should enjoy a significant reduction of hair. However, it will take 2-4 weeks for the treated hair to push its way to the surface and fall out. With each treatment, the hair in the active growing phase will be effectively treated. A follow up appointment is scheduled 4-8 weeks after each treatment. With that in mind, remember the importance of maintaining your follow up appointments. </p>
